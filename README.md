# Interacting with Ansible

There are 4 ways to interact with Ansible

* Playbooks & Roles

* Inventories & Plugins

* Modules

* Ansible Tower API

  * Discuss northbound & southbound API

Generally most partners will take an approach of crawl, walk, run. That  usually maps to something like:

**Crawl:** Focus on playbooks and roles to simplify deployment of one or multiple parts of your end deliverable

**Walk:** Creating dynamic inventories, plugins, or modules to enhance integration with your end deliverable

**Run:** Implementing the advanced features of Ansible Tower for an enterprise-class experience. This may be mapping select functionalities in your deliverable to specific northbound or southbound APIs, or offering a custom view of Ansible Tower within your deliverable.

This documentation will focus on these 4 ways for a few types of partners including:

* Systems Integrators

* Consulting partners

* OEM & ISV
